        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm a student at the <b>University of Texas at Austin</b> pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. 
            I'm particularly interested in machine learning, system security, and networking. See <a href="experience.html">experience</a> for more.
        </p>
        <p>Outside of work and school, I enjoy playing saxophone, trying new foods, and spending time with family. To keep my saxophone skills, I participate 
            in the University Saxophone Ensemble. Currently, I own a Yanagisawa TW02 and play on the included mouthpiece and blue box Vandoren 3.5 reeds.
        </p>
        <p>If you want to know what I'm doing currently, see <a href="happening-now.html">happening now</a> for a quick view into my current routine or check 
            out my <a href="blog.html">blog</a> for details on some of my projects.
        </p>
