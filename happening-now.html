        <p>This page is where you can find out about what I'm doing recently.</p>
        <h2>Life</h2>
        <p>
            I've recently moved to an apartment, transitioning from the Jester East, and apartment living is a big change from dorm life. 
            Now, I'm learning to cook for myself. Here are some of my most recent dishes I've made:

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>
            The University Saxophone Ensemble has just started. We still don't know when the concert will be but hopefully it'll be 
            announced soon! We will also be finalizing our program reportoire this week.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy listening to jazz, especially fusion, bebop, and swing. Some new tracks I'm listening to:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://youtu.be/tUZI5pi8IFg">Dolphin Shoals - 8 bit band Cover</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://youtu.be/9vA7JJI5ZUM">The Fly - Matrix</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://youtu.be/LcxZXxlOFx8">Caribe - Paquito D'Rivera, Michael Camilo, & others</a></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>University</h2>
        <h4>Longhorn Racing</h4>
        <p>
            Longhorn Racing is officially back in swing! We just had our first info night and open garage last week (maybe you saw me there!) 
            and will have some more through this week. I'm on the Solar car team, which competes in the 
            <a href="https://www.americansolarchallenge.org/about/formula-sun-grand-prix/">Formula Sun Grand Prix</a> and hopefully qualifies for 
            the <a href="https://www.americansolarchallenge.org/about/american-solar-challenge/">American Solar Challenge</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>Autonomous Robots</h4>
        <p>
            As a part of UT Austin's Freshman Research Initiative (FRI), I will be conducting research on a project that will be proposed this 
            week concerning human robot interaction. Stay tuned for details once it gets approved!
